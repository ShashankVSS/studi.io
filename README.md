# studi.io

STUDI.IO tracks your eyes upon the content that is chose for focusing. When a student stays focused, they will be rewarded points which are totalled onto a leaderboard. Conversely, if a student is not focused, points will not be awarded followed by an alert to nudge them back on track. The leaderboard is used as a competitive incentive among peers to keep studying to achieve a higher score.

This project was built using a flask backend to handle the accounts and scores, which are stored on Google Cloud. We used OpenCV to extract important facial features from a dataset we created, which we then fed to a Convolution Neural Network for training.
